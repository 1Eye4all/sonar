Project Sonar
=============

Project Sonar is a community effort to improve security through the active analysis of public networks. This includes running scans across public internet-facing systems, organizing the results, and sharing the data with the information security community. The three components to this project are tools, datasets, and research. This repository contains documentation, usage examples, and analysis results from the project.
